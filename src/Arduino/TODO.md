--> Make documentation for project
--> Complete MotionWithRotatingHCSR04.ino -- include the code for motion of the robot
--> Complete ObstacleAvoidance.ino -- test and stress test on different scenarios, simplify the code
--> Complete motor_driver.ino -- Remove speed controlling commands, test and stress test



Each file depends on the previous one. Hence needs to integrate the previous code
--> Step1: MotionWithRotatingHCSR04.ino
--> Step2: ObstacleAvoidance.ino
--> Step3: motor_driver.ino
